gamedev-deps
============

Scripts for downloading and/or building gamedev dependancies for Windows.

Open a Visual Studio Developer console and run the extract-build-curl-32bit.bat. This will give you instuctions to download the curl sources, and build curl.exe for you. 

Drag any other .bat file into the console to add the library to your development environment.
